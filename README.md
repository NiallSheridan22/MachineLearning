# Project Overview
In this project which is credit card fraud detection with machine learning. The question that is trying to be anwsered about the project is - Can ensemble machine learning be more accurate than a single supervised learning algorithm for Credit Card Fraud Detection. To do this there will be different algorithms used and tested to see how they score themseleves as well as that there will be supervised algorithms combined to see how the ensmeble compare to the singular algorithms.

# Installation
Software requirements -  Python it is open-source software with a wide range of installable libraries, including SciPy, NumPy, and many more that may be used to support machine learning. There are also Visualisation libraries that can help like Matplotlib and Seaborn. Google Colab for writing the code for the project.

Hardware requirements - There are hardware requirements required throughout the project but very little, a pc and laptop will be used.
