# Project Overview
In this project which is credit card fraud detection with machine learning. The question that is trying to be anwsered about the project is - Can ensemble machine learning be more accurate than a single supervised learning algorithm for Credit Card Fraud Detection. To do this there will be different algorithms used and tested to see how they score themseleves as well as that there will be supervised algorithms combined to see how the ensmeble compare to the singular algorithms.
